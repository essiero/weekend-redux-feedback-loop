## Description

_Duration: 48-hour sprint_

On this weekend sprint project, we were tasked with created a feedback app that gathers input from users using Reeact and Redux and stores it in a database.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- React.js
- Axios
- Redux
- Express
- BodyParser
- PG
- PostgreSQL

## Installation
1. Create a database named `prime_feedback` using your database manager.
2. Use the queries from the data.sql file to create your tables and seed it with a row of example data.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm install react-redux` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
6. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
7. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
This web app is designed as a survey to collect data from students about how understanding, sense of support, feelings, and any comments.
1. Use the dropdown menu to give a rating between 1 and 5 on feelings, understanding, and support; click the `NEXT` button to navigate to the next page.
2. Add any comments you'd like in the input field on the comments page.
3. Before you submit your feedback, you'll be able to view a summary and confirm that they are correct or go back and edit if there's anything you want to change.
4. Click the `submit` button and you're all set!
5. If you'd like to submit more feedback, click the `Leave new feedback` button and have at it.
