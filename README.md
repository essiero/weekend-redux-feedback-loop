# TO-DO's
- Feelings component => next button will use a react router to bring you to the next page/component and save your score as redux state

- Leave new feedback will bring you back to start page as well as clear all input fields.
- To reset input fields: return '', NOT state = ''
- We need to "npm install react-redux" - it's not in our package.json dependencies
